  title: The BIDS Models Specification
  leads:
    - name: Tal Yarkoni
    - name: Chris Markiewcz
  update: |
    Reworked structure:
    - list of steps is now a directed graph, 
    - [Model zoo](https://github.com/bids-standard/model-zoo){:target:'_blank'}, 
    - Abstracted transformations, to ease interoperability of implementations.
  blocking: Stat Models released v1.0.0-rc1 in June 2021 - Please review!

  title: The structural preprocessing derivatives
  leads:
    - name: Viviana Siless
  update: |
    Opened [pull request](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/518){:target:"_blank"}. 

    Features:
    - surfaces, 
    - scalar maps on surfaces
    - morphometrics. 

    Need to conform with final Common Derivatives and gather community feedback.

  leads:
    - name: Chris Markiewicz
  update: |
    Opened the [pull request](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/519){:target:"_blank"}. 
    
    Features:
    - Derivative images (mean, ALFF, ReHo, etc.), 
    - Time series (confounds, decompositions, etc.)

  title: The affine transformations and nonlinear field warps
  leads:
    - name: Oscar Esteban
  update: |  
   Creating file format (X5) to store spatial transforms. 

   [There is a software prototype - NiTransforms](https://osf.io/8aq7b/){:target:"_blank"} demonstrates implementation of this BEP. NiTransforms has been tested and integrated to work within fMRIPrep 
  blocking: In progress.

  title: The diffusion weighted imaging derivatives
  leads:
    - name: Franco Pestilli
    - name: Oscar Esteban
  update: |
    - Being discussed [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-bep016){:target:"_blank"}. 
    - Coordinating with BEP017.  
    - Diffusion-weighted model description merged, but must comply to [this](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-bep016/issues/7){:target:"_blank"}. 
    - Upcoming integration across DWI, Tractography, Tractometry, and Connectivity (from fMRI and DWI)   
  blocking: None

  leads:
    - name: Eugene Duff
  update: |
    - [Current state](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/bep017){:target:"_blank}. 
    - Intended as a meeting point for minimal harmonisation of connectivity-based formats across modalities. 
    - Seeking use cases spanning modalities and input defining connectivity based formats
