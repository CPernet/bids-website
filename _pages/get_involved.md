# Get involved in making BIDS better

The easiest way to contribute to BIDS is to ask questions you have about the specification on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org.)
If your question has a [bids tag](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids) it will be much easier for others to find the answer.

You can also get involved by _answering_ questions on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/search?q=tags%3Abids)!

You can contribute to the BIDS specification by opening [Issues](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues) and propose changes via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pulls) on [GitHub](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).

To make improvements to the website that you are reading right now, you can also open an [Issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/issues) and propose changes via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website/pulls) at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-website).

Do you want to extend BIDS to a new modality or set of data types? Please draft a BIDS Extension Proposal (BEP) following the [BIDS Contributor Guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWmEEY-1-WuwBPNy5tDAxVJYQ9Een4hZJM06tQZg8X4/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1537468908724000). You can also contribute to ongoing [BIDS Extension Proposals](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/06-extensions.html#bids-extension-proposals).

Please adhere to our [BIDS Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct).

Thank you for your contributions!
